This application leverages data extracted with [domain-scan](https://github.com/18F/domain-scan) to visualize the implementation of security practices on a selection of domains, specifically regarding the implementation of HTTPS, SPF, DMARC and HSTS.

Users can either use the default list of domains or upload their own *pshtt.csv* and *trustymail.csv* generated using domain-scan.

The application can be viewed at the following address:
